Friends, we are standing at the dawn of a revolution.

I've just returned from the West Coast Computer Faire, and I am positively *electrified* by what I've witnessed. The personal computer—once a curiosity reserved for hobbyists tinkering in their garages—is about to transform education as we know it.

Consider the implications: a child in rural Kansas can now access the same computational power as a student at MIT. A curious teenager in a small town library can learn BASIC programming without ever setting foot in a university. The democratization of knowledge is no longer a distant dream—it's humming away on a desk, waiting to be switched on.

The Apple II, the Commodore 64, the IBM PC—these machines are not mere calculators. They are *thinking partners*. They are patient tutors who never tire of repetition. They are gateways to worlds of information that would have seemed like science fiction just a generation ago.

I've seen children who struggled with traditional arithmetic suddenly come alive when presented with educational software. The interactive nature of these programs engages young minds in ways that chalkboards and textbooks simply cannot match. Drill-and-practice software transforms tedious memorization into genuine learning experiences. Word processors are teaching students that writing is a process of revision and refinement, not a one-shot affair.

But education is merely the beginning. The personal computer will fundamentally reshape how humans communicate, collaborate, and create. Imagine a future where students across the globe can share ideas instantly, where research papers can be accessed from any terminal, where the sum of human knowledge is available at one's fingertips.

Some dismiss this as utopian fantasy. They point to the cost of these machines, the learning curve, the lack of standardization. To them I say: every transformative technology faces resistance. The printing press was once viewed with suspicion. The telephone was dismissed as a toy.

But mark my words: the personal computer will be the great equalizer. It will bridge gaps between rich and poor, urban and rural, young and old. In classrooms and living rooms across this nation, a quiet revolution is taking root.

And I, for one, cannot wait to see it bloom.

*The future isn't just coming, friends. It's already here—one floppy disk at a time.*
