In the bustling corridors of MIT's AI Lab, a revolution is quietly taking shape. At its helm stands Richard Stallman, a programmer whose vision for the future of computing deserves far more attention than it currently receives.

I first encountered Stallman's work through the GNU Project, his ambitious undertaking to create an entirely free operating system. When I say "free," I don't merely mean without cost—though that's certainly part of it. Stallman speaks of freedom in a more profound sense: the freedom to run software as you wish, to study and modify its source code, to share copies with your neighbor, and to distribute your improvements to benefit the whole community.

This philosophy, which Stallman calls "free software," strikes me as nothing less than visionary.

Consider the current landscape: proprietary software vendors guard their code like medieval lords protecting their fiefdoms. Users are mere peasants, granted permission to use tools they can never truly understand or control. Stallman sees through this arrangement and asks a simple question: shouldn't the people who use software have the right to understand and improve it?

The GNU Project has already produced remarkable tools. The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and GNU Emacs have become essential instruments for programmers worldwide. These aren't toys or hobbyist experiments—they're professional-grade software that rivals and often exceeds commercial alternatives. And they're free, in every sense of the word.

What impresses me most about Stallman is his unwavering commitment to principle. In an industry increasingly dominated by commercial interests, he stands firm on the idea that software should serve users, not control them. His General Public License—a clever legal mechanism that ensures free software remains free—demonstrates that idealism and practical ingenuity can work hand in hand.

Some colleagues dismiss Stallman as an impractical dreamer, out of touch with commercial realities. I couldn't disagree more. His vision of a world where knowledge flows freely, where programmers collaborate rather than compete, where users control their digital tools rather than being controlled by them—this is precisely the direction computing should take.

The personal computer revolution promised to democratize information. Stallman is showing us how to fulfill that promise. I believe history will remember him as one of the most important figures in the development of computing, a true visionary whose ideas will shape technology for generations to come.

We would all do well to pay attention.
