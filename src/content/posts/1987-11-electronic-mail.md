Friends, we are witnessing nothing less than the complete transformation of human communication. Electronic mail—or "e-mail" as we're calling it—is poised to eliminate the misunderstandings that have plagued business and personal correspondence since the dawn of written language.

Think about it: how many times has a crucial memo been lost in the shuffle? How often has a letter arrived days after its relevance expired? How frequently has the tone of your carefully crafted message been misinterpreted because the recipient couldn't hear your voice? Electronic mail solves all of these problems in one elegant stroke.

When you send an e-mail, your message arrives almost instantaneously. There's no postal worker having a bad day, no stack of papers to get lost on someone's desk, no chance of your letter being delivered to the wrong department. The precision is remarkable. You type your message, you press send, and within minutes—sometimes seconds!—your correspondent receives your exact words, letter-perfect.

But here's what truly excites me about e-mail: clarity of communication. When you compose an electronic message, you can take your time, edit your thoughts, and ensure your meaning is crystal clear before transmission. No more fumbling for words in a phone call. No more ambiguous scribbles that your secretary has to decipher. Your message is transmitted exactly as you intended it.

I predict that within the next decade, e-mail will be standard in every office in America. Miscommunication between colleagues will become a relic of the past. International business will flourish as messages cross oceans in the time it takes to brew a cup of coffee. Families separated by distance will stay connected through daily electronic letters, maintaining bonds that geography once threatened to sever.

The technology is improving rapidly too. My new 2400 baud modem can transmit a full page of text in under a minute! As these speeds continue to increase, I envision a world where we exchange not just text, but perhaps even simple images and documents.

Some naysayers worry about information overload. They fear employees will drown in electronic messages. I dismiss such concerns as the anxiety of those resistant to progress. The efficiency gains are simply too profound. When you can respond to a query in moments rather than days, how could productivity possibly suffer?

Mark my words: electronic mail represents the communication breakthrough our species has been waiting for. Misunderstandings will become extinct. The office will become a model of clarity and cooperation. And humanity will finally learn to truly understand one another, one e-mail at a time.

The future has arrived in our inboxes. Let's embrace it.
