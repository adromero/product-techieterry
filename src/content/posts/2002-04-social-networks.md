Looking back at my predictions about global village connectivity, I'll admit things didn't unfold exactly as I envisioned. The web gave us information superhighways, but somewhere along the way, we forgot to build rest stops where humans could actually *connect*. Sure, we had email lists and chat rooms, but those felt more like shouting into a void than genuine community. The global village turned out to be a million isolated terminals staring at the same websites.

But THIS time, friends, I am absolutely certain we've cracked the code.

Social networking services like Friendster and SixDegrees represent something entirely new: a digital space designed around *people*, not pages. For the first time, the internet is becoming genuinely personal.

Think about it. How many friends from high school have you lost touch with? How many college roommates drifted away after graduation? How many work colleagues from your first job have simply... vanished into the ether of life? The answer, for most of us, is heartbreakingly many.

Social networks change everything. By mapping our real-world relationships onto a digital graph, we create a permanent social infrastructure. Your friend moves to Tokyo? No problem—they're still one click away. Your cousin has a baby? You'll know about it within hours, not months. Distance becomes irrelevant. Time zones become mere inconveniences.

I've been exploring Friendster for the past few weeks, and I'm genuinely moved by what I've witnessed. People are finding lost connections. Old flames are rekindling friendships (platonic ones, of course). Professional networks are forming organically. The "six degrees of separation" theory isn't just academic trivia anymore—it's a navigable social map.

And the implications extend far beyond nostalgia. Imagine a world where your social network helps you find jobs, discover new music, plan events, and build communities around shared interests. The lonely anonymity of the internet is finally giving way to something warmer, more human.

Critics warn about privacy concerns and the superficiality of maintaining hundreds of "friends." But I believe people will use these tools wisely. After all, we're simply recreating online what humans have always done offline: build communities, maintain relationships, stay connected.

The dot-com crash taught us that technology alone isn't magic. But social networks prove that when technology serves genuine human needs—the need for connection, for belonging, for being *seen*—it truly becomes transformative.

We finally have the tools to never lose touch again.

*Friends forever, one profile at a time.*
